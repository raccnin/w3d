    "description": "Dr Pepper's unique, sparkling blend of 23 fruit flavours has been around for well over a century and it's still the same, with that distinctive flavour you just can't quite put your tongue on. It was created by Texas pharmacist Charles Alderton in 1885. He gave a sample of the first ever batch to Wade Morrison, a local shop owner, and Mr Morrison instantly agreed to stock the drink. The distinctive, bold taste of Dr Pepper has been popular ever since.",
